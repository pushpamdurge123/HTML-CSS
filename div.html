            <span style="background-color:yellow;text-decoration:underline;color:red;font-weight:900;font-size:30px">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language
         for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</span> It 
         defines the content and structure of web content. It is often 
         assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
          and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
 storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML 
 describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
  included cues for its appearance.

        <h2> Java</h2>
        <p>
            <span style="background-color:yellow;text-decoration:underline;color:red;font-weight:900;font-size:30px">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming 
            language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies
             as possible.</span> It is a general-purpose programming language intended 
             to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that
              compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without
               the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled
                to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless
                 of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is 
                 similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than 
                 either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities 
                 (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are 
                 typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
             specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in
              a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects 
              such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology
               of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
