        <p class="my-para"> 
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the 
            presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
             or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone
              technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
             colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further 
             explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of 
             presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by 
             specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
              repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve
               the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
