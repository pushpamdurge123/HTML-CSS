                Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup
                 language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
                  browser. It defines the content and structure of web 
                  ontent. It is often assisted by technologies <br/><br/><br/><br/>such as 
                  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br/><br/>
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or
                 from local storage and render the documents into multimedia 
                 web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page 
                 semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
