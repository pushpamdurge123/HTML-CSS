        <h1> PHP </h1>

            PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared 
            towards web development.[8] It was originally created 
            by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 
            and released in 1995.[9][10] The PHP reference implementation
             is now produced by the PHP Group.[11] PHP was originally\
              an abbreviation of Personal Home Page,[12][13] but it now
               stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[14]

               PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP 
               interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common 
               Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the 
               result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may 
               be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image
                data—would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. 
                Various web template systems, web content management systems
                , and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate
                 or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, 
                 PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web 
                 context, such as standalone graphical applications[15] and 
                 drone control.[16] PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.

The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software
 released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be 
 deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.[17]
The PHP language has evolved without a written formal specification or 
standard, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard
 that other implementations aimed to follow.
